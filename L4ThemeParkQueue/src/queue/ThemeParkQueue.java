/*
 * CS112 Queue Lab
 * 
 * Implement enqueue(), dequeue() using a linked-list based queue of strings
 * to represent a line of people waiting for a theme park attraction
 * 
 * This Queue uses two pointers, one to store the front of the line and one to store the back. 
 * Each person is represented by a node called a Rider, which holds a string. 
 * 
 * The Rider at the front of the line is dequeued first, and that Rider has a "next" attribute
 * which points to the person behind them. Riders are enqueued at the end of the line.
 * 
 * i.e.
 * frontOfLine -> Rider -> Rider -> endOfLine ->
 *     ^                                             ^
 * dequeue from here                        enqueue here
